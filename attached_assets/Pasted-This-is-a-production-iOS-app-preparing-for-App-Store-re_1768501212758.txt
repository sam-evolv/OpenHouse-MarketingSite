This is a production iOS app preparing for App Store review. The app is already functionally complete. The goal is to remove any remaining ambiguity for Apple reviewers and align metadata, support, and review flow with App Store best practice.

Objectives

Implement the following improvements without altering core app functionality:

1. App Review Sign-In Clarity (Critical)

The app does not use usernames or passwords. Access is via a property-specific access code.

Actions:

Update App Review notes copy (and any surfaced reviewer-facing text) to explicitly state:

No accounts

No passwords

Access via developer-issued property code

Ensure the review flow is obvious on first launch (code entry is the only gate).

If a demo code exists, ensure it is clearly documented for reviewers.

Required wording intent (not verbatim):

“This app does not require login credentials. Reviewers can access the demo environment using the provided property access code.”

2. Support Page Compliance Check

Confirm the support page at
https://openhouseai.ie/support
meets Apple’s expectations:

It must clearly include:

App description and purpose

Support contact email (already present)

App Review Information section explaining access model

Privacy & data handling summary

Links to Privacy Policy and Terms

Actions:

Verify headings are semantic and clear

Ensure content is readable on mobile

No marketing fluff – functional, factual tone only

No redesign required. Content clarity only.

3. Screenshots & App Previews (No Changes Needed)

Confirm and lock in:

0 App Previews is acceptable (screenshots only is valid)

iPhone screenshots are sufficient

No iPad or Apple Watch screenshots required

No action required unless warnings appear.

4. Promotional Text Guardrail

Ensure promotional text:

Is under character limit

Does not include claims Apple could challenge (no “AI guarantees”, no automation promises)

Focuses on clarity, access, and organisation

Lock copy once validated.

5. Routing App Coverage File (Explicitly Skip)

Do not add a Routing App Coverage .geojson file.

Reason:

App is not a navigation or routing app

Feature is optional and not applicable

Ensure no placeholder or empty file is attached.

6. Final App Review Notes (Add This)

Populate the App Review Notes field with a short, professional explanation including:

Access method

Demo availability

Support contact

Statement that app content is property-specific and static per development

Tone: factual, cooperative, concise.

7. Risk Guardrails

Do NOT:

Introduce user accounts

Add authentication complexity

Add App Clips

Add analytics disclosures beyond what already exists

Change privacy posture

Acceptance Criteria

Apple reviewer can access the app in under 30 seconds

No ambiguity around sign-in

Support page satisfies App Review checklist

No unnecessary optional assets attached

Submission is clean, minimal, and defensible

Proceed step-by-step.
Do not refactor unrelated code.
Confirm each item as completed before moving on.
