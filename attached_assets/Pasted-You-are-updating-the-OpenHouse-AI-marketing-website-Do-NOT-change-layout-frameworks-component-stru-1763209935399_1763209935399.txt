You are updating the OpenHouse AI marketing website.
Do NOT change layout frameworks, component structure, navigation code, Lenis scroll setup, or styling.
Only update content inside existing sections, and create new sections ONLY using existing section patterns.
Do NOT delete animations, hero visuals, or design elements.
Your task is to update text content across the site so it reflects the final OpenHouse AI product architecture.

1. Update the HERO section (app/page.tsx or relevant section component)

Replace the hero text ONLY with:

Headline: “The AI resident portal for modern developments.”

Subheading: “Instant onboarding, intelligent support, and a unified knowledge engine for every home you build — powered by automation, NFC activation, and a multi-tenant developer dashboard.”

Keep both buttons. Do not move or restyle anything.

2. Insert new section BELOW the hero using existing section-style component

Add a new section titled:

“Built for Developers. Loved by Residents.”
With three highlights:

Reduce after-sales volumes by 70–90%

Effortless, automated handover experience

Premium, modern resident experience from day one

Use existing typography + spacing utilities.

3. Update the FEATURES section to reflect the real modules

Modify the text inside the existing cards only.
Do NOT alter icons, grid layout, or animations.

Replace card content with:

Resident Portal

AI assistant, manuals, drawings, warranties, POI mapping, community tools.

Developer Command Center

Manage multiple schemes, upload documents, push updates, global edits, role-based access, analytics.

Handover Automation

NFC/QR activation, welcome journeys, templated onboarding, scheme cloning.

AI Knowledge Engine

RAG ingestion, multi-phrase intent mapping, issue categorisation, predictive FAQs.

Leave card styles untouched.

4. Add a new “Product Architecture” section using an existing section pattern

This must use the existing Section component but with new text only.
No new custom components.

Section title: “A Modern Multi-Tenant Platform Architected for Scale.”

Bullet points:

Multi-tenant core (developers, OMCs, residents)

RAG knowledge engine

Onboarding layer (QR/NFC)

Developer dashboard

POI engine

Analytics layer (query trends, knowledge gaps, monthly reporting)

GDPR + EU data residency + audit logs

No images or diagrams required — simple text structure.

5. Add a “How It Works” section using an existing simple 3-step layout

Steps:

Scan the NFC tag — the home activates instantly.

AI welcomes the resident by name and answers any home-specific question.

Developer dashboard manages documents, updates, and analytics across all schemes.

6. Add a “Security & Compliance” section

Use existing styling for informational sections.
Include:

GDPR-first

EU data storage

Audit logs

No LLM training on customer data

Encryption at rest & in transit

Scheme-level sandboxing

7. Add a “Developer Engagement Model” section

Steps:

Discovery & data ingest

Scheme setup (minutes)

AI knowledge build

NFC/QR deployment

Go-live

Monthly insights

Use existing typography + spacing.
