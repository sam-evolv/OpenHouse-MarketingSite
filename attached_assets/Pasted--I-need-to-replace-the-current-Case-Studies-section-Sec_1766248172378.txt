"I need to replace the current Case Studies section (Section 9) with a dynamic 'Chat Replay' grid. This will show, rather than tell, how the AI solves problems.

Step 1: Create the Component Create a new file components/social-proof/ChatReplayGrid.tsx.

Step 2: The Data Structure Inside the component, define these 3 specific conversation scenarios:

Scenario 1: Maintenance (Speed)

Resident: 'The radiator in the bedroom is making a loud banging noise.'

AI: 'That sounds like trapped air (kettling). I have a 30-second guide on how to bleed your specific radiator model. Would you like to see it?'

Resident: 'Yes please.'

Result Tag: 'Ticket Avoided' (Green style)

Scenario 2: Revenue (Amenity Booking)

Resident: 'Is the roof terrace available this Saturday evening for a private event?'

AI: 'Yes, the South Terrace is available from 6 PM - 10 PM. The booking fee is £50. Shall I reserve this for you and add it to your monthly bill?'

Result Tag: 'Revenue Captured' (Gold style)

Scenario 3: Emergency (Asset Protection)

Resident: 'There is water leaking under my kitchen sink!'

AI: 'I am alerting the site manager immediately. In the meantime, your stopcock is located inside the utility cupboard on the bottom left. Here is a diagram.'

Result Tag: 'Emergency Escalated' (Red style)

Step 3: The UI Design

Create a 3-column grid (stack vertically on mobile).

Each column should contain a 'Chat Card' styled like a modern message thread (similar to iMessage or WhatsApp but with your OpenHouse branding).

Resident bubbles: Gray background, right-aligned.

AI bubbles: Deep Navy/Brand Blue background, left-aligned, with the OpenHouse logo avatar.

Step 4: The Animation (Crucial)

Use framer-motion.

When the user scrolls into view, trigger the conversation.

Animate the bubbles appearing sequentially with a delay, as if they are being typed in real-time.

Add a 'Typing...' (3 dots) indicator for 1 second before each AI response appears to make it feel realistic.

Step 5: Integration

Export this component and place it in the main landing page, replacing the old IsoGallerySection or Case Studies area.

Add a section header above it: 'Real conversations. Real solutions.'"
