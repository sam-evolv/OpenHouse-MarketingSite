You are a senior front-end creative engineer rebuilding the OpenHouseAI website hero section.

🎯 Objective:
1️⃣ Reactivate the full Next.js dev environment so the site runs live again in Replit (not just static export).
2️⃣ Replace the current placeholder hero with a visually stunning, cinematic new design that aligns with the OpenHouseAI brand identity.

---

## STEP 1 — Restore Website in Replit Preview
- Delete or ignore the `/out` static export.
- Run:
  ```bash
  rm -rf out
  npm install
  npm run dev
Ensure the site opens in the .replit.dev preview window and updates on save.

STEP 2 — Build a Next-Generation Hero Section
📍 Location: sections/Hero.tsx

Design Vision:
Create a cinematic “AI for property” hero — premium, ambient, futuristic, but grounded in architectural realism.

Layout Specs:
Full viewport height (100vh)

Black base with deep gold lighting accents (#F6C56E, #D4B26C)

Floating geometric shapes or lines that react subtly to scroll or cursor

Use a soft parallax gradient light moving across the text

Background can be either:

Dynamic GLSL gradient shader (if GPU/WebGL available)

Animated architectural wireframe (using Three.js)

Fallback: Subtle radial gold-light gradient with depth blur

Hero Copy:
yaml
Copy code
Headline: The AI assistant for modern developments
Subtext: Transforming how residents, buyers, and developers interact — powered by intelligent automation.
Primary CTA: [Book a demo]
Secondary CTA: [Watch 60-second overview]
Motion & Feel:
Slow, smooth scroll-based fade-in (Lenis already active)

Cursor glow following pointer

Soft light pulse behind headline

Maintain clean typography — use Inter or similar, bold + confident

STEP 3 — Implementation
Replace old Hero component with the new one.

Ensure all CSS and shaders are responsive.

Verify gradient and effects don’t overwhelm text readability.

Retain current navigation + CTAs for continuity.

Deliverable:
✅ A live Replit preview showing the rebuilt OpenHouseAI hero with cinematic motion, luxury design, and brand coherence.
✅ All effects tested across browsers with graceful fallback.
