Replit Agent Prompt (Phase 5 – Hero Narrative Tightening)

Goal:
Tighten the hero section narrative so it clearly sets up the full story of the page:
AI assistant → resident experience → developer visibility → modern handover.
This is a copy and hierarchy refinement only. Do not change layout, animations, or visual structure.

Context:
The page now correctly explains:
- Two portals (Resident + Developer)
- AI assistant trained on home-specific data
- Community framed as infrastructure
The hero must now tee this up clearly and cleanly.

Tasks:

1) Locate the hero section component (headline, subheading, primary CTA).
2) Update the hero copy ONLY (no layout or style changes).

Replace the current hero headline with (verbatim):

"The AI platform for modern residential developments"

3) Update the hero subheading to (verbatim):

"Give residents clear answers, reduce post-handover friction, and give developers visibility into what happens after keys are handed over."

4) Optional emphasis line (only if the hero already supports a secondary line or highlighted phrase):
If there is an existing accent/emphasis line, update it to:

"From handover to everyday living"

Do NOT add this if it would require new markup.

5) CTA alignment check:
- Keep the primary CTA exactly as-is (e.g. “Book a Demo” / “Start Free”).
- Do not add, remove, or rename buttons.
- Ensure the copy supports both residents and developers without explicitly naming them again (this avoids redundancy with the next section).

Tone and language constraints (critical):
- UK English
- No quantified claims
- No superlatives (e.g. “best”, “leading”)
- No buzzwords (e.g. “revolutionary”, “next-gen”)
- Calm, confident, infrastructure-level language

Narrative acceptance test:
After this change, the page should read logically as:
Hero (what + why) →
Two Portals (who) →
AI Assistant (how) →
Community & Documents (what it replaces) →
Developer Insight (why it matters)

Deliverable:
- Copy-only changes in the hero section.
- Confirm no CLS, spacing, or animation regressions.
- Brief summary listing the file edited and the old vs new copy.
