You are working inside the repository: OpenHouseAI (Next.js + TS). Objective: update the HERO “chat replay” card copy so it no longer says “Your parcel has arrived at reception.” Replace it with a GDPR-safe, liability-safe scenario that reflects real OpenHouse functionality (document retrieval), without providing any specific measurements or personal/sensitive data.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do NOT change layout, styling, animations, timings, or card positions.
- Do NOT introduce new libraries.
- Do NOT add API calls.
- Only change the hardcoded demo text for the OpenHouse Assistant chat card in the hero.
- Keep text short so it fits the card at all breakpoints.

TARGET COPY (use exactly this)
Card header: "OpenHouse Assistant"
Status: "Online"
User message (top bubble):
"What size is my living room?"
Assistant response (second bubble):
"I’ve found your architectural floor plans.
View or download them here for the official room dimensions."

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1) Find where the hero chat replay cards are defined:
   - Search the repo for the exact string: "Your parcel has arrived at reception"
   - Also search for: "OpenHouse Assistant" and "Online"
2) Identify the component that renders the hero animated cards (likely under one of these folders):
   - sections/
   - components/
   - app/
3) Update ONLY the text content for that specific OpenHouse Assistant card:
   - Replace the existing “parcel/reception” user message with the new user question.
   - Replace the existing second bubble text with the new assistant response.
   - If the component expects the assistant response as a single string, keep the line break using \n (or <br /> if it is JSX). Prefer \n if the existing code uses it.
   - If there is a “Collection …” line underneath, replace it with something neutral and true (no times, no tracking codes). Use:
     "Document available in your Home Pack."
     If that line does not exist, do not add it.
4) Ensure no measurements, addresses, names, unit numbers, or any identifiable info appear in this card.
5) Run and verify:
   - `npm run dev`
   - Confirm the hero card now shows the new question and the document-based answer.
   - Confirm text does not overflow or clip on mobile and desktop.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
- Tell me the exact file path(s) edited.
- Paste the before/after snippet of the edited object/JSX block only (not the whole file).
