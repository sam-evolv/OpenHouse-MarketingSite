Replit Agent Prompt (Final Optional Phase – Conversion Sanity Check)

Goal:
Validate and lightly refine the conversion flow so the primary CTA feels inevitable, well-timed, and low-friction. No redesign. No new sections. Minimal, reversible changes only.

Scope:
Marketing site only.
Hero → mid-page → final CTA band.

Tasks:

1) Primary CTA consistency check
   - Confirm the primary CTA label is consistent everywhere (e.g. “Book a Demo”).
   - If any variants exist (e.g. “Request Demo”, “Get Started”), standardise all to the single strongest version already in use.
   - Do not change button styling, colour, or animation.

2) CTA timing and placement audit
   - Verify there is:
     a) One primary CTA in the hero
     b) One supporting CTA after the core explanation sections (Two Portals + AI clarification)
     c) One final CTA band above the footer
   - If any extra CTA blocks exist beyond these three, remove the weakest one.
   - Do not add new CTAs.

3) CTA microcopy (optional but recommended)
   - If the primary CTA supports helper text beneath it, add a single low-risk reassurance line:
     “No commitment. Short walkthrough.”
   - If helper text already exists, do not add another.

4) Audience ambiguity check
   - Ensure CTA copy does not assume the user is already a customer or resident.
   - Avoid language like “Get started now” if the product is demo-led.
   - Keep the CTA neutral and invitation-based.

5) Friction scan
   - Click the CTA and confirm:
     - No unexpected form length
     - No jargon-heavy first screen
     - No pricing wall before explanation
   - If friction exists, note it but do not redesign unless explicitly instructed.

Constraints (critical):
- Copy and removal only.
- No new components.
- No visual redesign.
- No analytics or tracking changes.
- No backend or form logic changes.

Acceptance checks:
1) The first CTA feels safe to click for a developer.
2) The final CTA feels like a natural conclusion, not a sales push.
3) There is exactly one dominant action a visitor can take at any moment.

Deliverable:
- Short summary of:
  - CTA count before vs after
  - Any text standardised
  - Any CTA removed (if applicable)
