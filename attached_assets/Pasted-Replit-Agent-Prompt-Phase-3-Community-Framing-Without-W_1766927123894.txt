Replit Agent Prompt (Phase 3 – Community Framing Without WhatsApp Language)

Goal:
Refine how the community feature is framed across the marketing site so it reads as a considered, built-in development communication layer, not a replacement for WhatsApp or informal group chats.

This is a copy and framing pass only. Do not add new sections, cards, or visuals.

Scope:
Marketing site sections that reference:
- Community
- Notice boards
- Resident updates
- Local announcements

Primary objective:
Position the feature as a structured, development-owned communication channel that builds clarity and connection, not noise.

Tasks:

1) Locate the feature card or copy that references:
   - “Community notice board”
   - “Local updates”
   - Any language that could imply casual group chat behaviour

2) Update the wording to the following approved framing (use verbatim where possible):

Title (if applicable):
"Resident Notice Board"

Primary description:
"A shared, development-wide notice board for official updates, local information, and resident announcements."

Supporting line (optional, if space allows):
"Clear communication, without fragmented channels or message overload."

3) If bullets are used, ensure they are structured and professional:
- "Development-wide updates and notices"
- "Local information relevant to residents"
- "A single, shared place for communication"

4) Explicitly avoid:
- Mentioning WhatsApp, group chats, social feeds, or messaging apps
- Casual or social language (e.g. “chat”, “message”, “post to the group”)
- Emojis or informal phrasing

5) Tone guardrails:
- Calm
- Structured
- Trustworthy
- Reads like infrastructure, not social media

Constraints (critical):
- Copy-only changes.
- No layout, spacing, animation, or icon changes.
- No new sections or cards.
- Do not rename the feature in navigation or product code.
- Do not touch portals, backend, or demo components.

Acceptance checks:
1) A developer reading this sees it as controlled, useful, and low-risk.
2) A resident understands it as an official source of information.
3) The feature feels complementary to the AI assistant, not redundant.

Deliverable:
- Updated copy in-place.
- Brief summary listing which file(s) were edited and what text was changed.
