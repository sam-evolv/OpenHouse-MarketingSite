You are updating the OpenHouse AI marketing website to complete the final transformation into a polished, enterprise-grade SaaS website.
You may modify components, layouts, grids, Tailwind classes, sections, and content.
Do NOT modify:

Navigation / header

Footer

Lenis scroll

Global stylesheets

Hero visuals

Animations

Routes

Any backend code

This task is focused exclusively on site polish, content clarity, layout refinement, new sections, and enterprise credibility building.

Follow every instruction below exactly.

1. UPGRADE THE SOLUTIONS PAGE (HIGH PRIORITY)

File: app/solutions/page.tsx (or equivalent section file)

Replace the entire content with a three-pillar stakeholder layout, followed by four use-case blocks.

A. TOP SECTION — Three Primary Stakeholder Columns

Use a 3-column responsive grid:

grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-12 py-28

Columns:

1. Developers

Multi-scheme oversight

Document management

Global updates

Analytics & reporting

Handover automation

Issue trend insights

2. OMCs / Property Managers

Issue categorisation

Resident communication

Warranty workflows

Manual uploads

Access to query history

Trending topics / common issues

3. Residents

NFC / QR onboarding

Personalised home AI assistant

Local POI mapping

Manuals, drawings, warranties

Community tools

24/7 support

Use the same card component style as Feature cards (consistent padding, min-height, icon slot).

B. SECOND SECTION — Use-Case Blocks

Add four smaller boxes directly under:

After-Sales Support

Handover & Completions

International Buyer Support

Resident Engagement

Grid:
grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8 py-20

Each card follows the style of a simplified feature card.

C. Add One Visual (Mock Screenshot Placeholder)

Below the use-case row:

Create a placeholder area in a bordered, rounded container

Use /public/mock-dashboard.png if available, or insert a placeholder block with “Dashboard Preview Coming Soon”

Ensure it does not break spacing or alignment

2. ADD A “WHY OPENHOUSE AI” TRUST SECTION

Create a new section component (e.g., sections/WhyOpenHouse.tsx) and add it to the homepage just before the footer CTA.

Section Title:
Why OpenHouse AI

Use 5 cards in a grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-6.

Cards:

Built for developers

Reduces inbound queries by 70–90%

Enterprise-grade security

Fast onboarding

Future-proof handover infrastructure

Cards use same feature card styling.

Spacing: py-28

3. ADD AN ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM SECTION

Create a simple diagrammatic block (not a real image — use styled divs and arrows).

Location:
Just below “A Modern Multi-Tenant Platform Architected for Scale.”

Section Title:
How OpenHouse AI Works Behind the Scenes

Diagram layout (horizontal or vertical stack):

Resident → AI Assistant → RAG Engine → Developer Dashboard → OMC Tools

Use boxes with rounded borders and arrows (→ or tailwind arrow icons).

Container constraints: max-w-5xl mx-auto py-20

This section is purely visual and must not break existing typography.

4. ENHANCE THE PRICING PAGE FOR ENTERPRISE READINESS

File: app/pricing/page.tsx

A. Add a feature comparison table

Place it below the pricing cards.

Columns:

Starter

Growth

Enterprise

Rows:

Number of developments

AI query volume

Document storage

Custom branding

Advanced analytics

White-label options

SLA

Developer dashboard

Monthly reporting

Integrations

Style it using a simple bordered table with:
border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-8

B. Add an Enterprise CTA below the table

Box with gold border and gold button:

“Need custom requirements, migrations, or multi-region deployments?”
Button: “Book Enterprise Consultation”

Spacing: py-20

5. ADD A FOOTER CTA SECTION BEFORE THE FOOTER

Title:
Ready to modernise the resident experience across your developments?

Subtitle:
Book a demo and see how OpenHouse AI transforms handover, support, and homeowner satisfaction.

Buttons:

Book a demo

Download Overview PDF (placeholder link /overview.pdf)

Container: py-28 bg-carbon/30 rounded-2xl

6. ADD FAQ SECTION BELOW PRICING

Create a simple accordion (use existing components if any).

FAQs:

How do residents access OpenHouse AI?

How is data stored?

Do you support white-labelling?

How quickly can we onboard a new scheme?

Do we need to train the AI ourselves?

What languages do you support?

Spacing: py-28

7. ICON CONSISTENCY CHECK

Across:

Features

Security

Solutions

Why OpenHouse

Use-cases

Pricing table

Standardise to one icon set (Lucide or existing gold icons).

Replace inconsistent icons with the chosen set.

Do NOT introduce new dependencies.

8. TIGHTEN TYPOGRAPHY AND SPACING

Global enforcement:

All section headings use the same size + weight

All py-28 between major sections

All inner container use: max-w-screen-xl mx-auto px-6

All text uses consistent line-height and letter-spacing

Ensure no section is overly verbose (keep bullets crisp)

9. ENSURE NOTHING BREAKS

You must verify:

No navigation issues

No console errors

No layout shifts

All grids responsive

All new sections integrate with existing theme

No impact on hero visuals

No modification to Lenis scroll

No broken imports

10. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Once all changes are made:

Show a diff of modified sections

Confirm all grids, cards, spacing, and visuals

Confirm no files outside components/sections/pages were changed besides content JSON

Restart server and verify
