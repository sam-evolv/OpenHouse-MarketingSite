Replit Agent Prompt – Dynamic Feature Tile (No Alerts, No Claims)

Goal:
Add a dynamic, animated feature tile beneath the existing “Live Analytics” card that feels active and alive, without implying alerts, notifications, or unshipped functionality.

Context:
There is currently a feature grid containing:
- Multi-Language
- Handover Automation
- Live Analytics

There is visual space beneath Live Analytics that must be filled with a tile of equal visual weight and motion.

Instructions:

1. Add ONE new feature card directly beneath “Live Analytics” using the same card component, layout, spacing, borders, and hover behaviour.

2. Card content (use verbatim):

   Title:
   Platform Activity

   Description:
   Ongoing interaction across documents, queries, and resident usage.

3. Visual behaviour (required):

   Implement a subtle, continuous animation inside the card using ONE of the following patterns:
   - Soft gold pulse lines moving horizontally (preferred), OR
   - Slowly cycling generic activity rows with fade transitions, OR
   - A calm oscillating waveform or bar animation.

   The animation must:
   - Loop continuously
   - Be passive (no user interaction required)
   - Use existing gold/porcelain colour palette
   - Have lower visual intensity than “Live Analytics”

4. Icon:
   Use a neutral system or activity-style icon.
   Do NOT use bells, alerts, notifications, warnings, or badges.

Critical Constraints:
- Do NOT mention alerts, notifications, or real-time triggers
- Do NOT introduce numbers, percentages, or metrics
- Do NOT add tooltips or hover text implying action
- Do NOT modify grid CSS or breakpoints
- Reuse existing animation utilities if available
- Respect reduced-motion preferences

Acceptance Criteria:
- The tile feels alive and dynamic on first glance
- It complements Live Analytics without competing
- No implied promises beyond passive system activity
- Grid looks visually complete on desktop and mobile

Deliverable:
One animated feature card added beneath Live Analytics with no other diffs.
