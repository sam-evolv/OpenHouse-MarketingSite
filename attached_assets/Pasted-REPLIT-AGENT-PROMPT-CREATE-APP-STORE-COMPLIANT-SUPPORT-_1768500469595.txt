REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — CREATE APP STORE–COMPLIANT SUPPORT PAGE

Objective
Create a public Support page at:
https://openhouseai.ie/support

This page is required for Apple App Store submission and must be clear, functional, and aligned with the existing OpenHouse AI marketing site design and tone.

Constraints
- Do NOT redesign the site.
- Do NOT introduce new branding styles.
- Reuse existing fonts, colours, spacing, and layout patterns.
- Page must load quickly and work on mobile.
- No animations beyond what already exists on the site.
- No gated content or login.

Content requirements (must include all)

1. Page Header
Title:
“OpenHouse AI Support”

Subtitle:
“Help and support for homeowners using the OpenHouse AI app.”

2. What the App Is (Apple clarity requirement)
Short paragraph explaining:
- OpenHouse AI is a property information portal for homeowners
- Accessed via a property-specific access code provided by the developer
- Used to view documents, notices, local information, and an AI assistant

Keep this factual. No marketing language.

3. Support Contact (mandatory)
Clearly display:
- Support email: support@openhouseai.ie
- Instruction: “For support, please email us and include your property access code if available.”

Email should be mailto-linked.

4. Common Support Topics (simple list)
Include a short bullet list such as:
- Trouble accessing the app with a property code
- Missing or incorrect documents
- Questions about local amenities or notices
- General app feedback or technical issues

This reassures Apple that support exists.

5. App Review Transparency Section (important)
Add a clearly labeled section:
“App Review Information”

Text must explain:
- The app does not use usernames or passwords
- Access is via a property-specific code
- No personal account creation is required
- Codes are issued by property developers
- Demo access is available for App Review upon request

This helps Apple reviewers and reduces rejection risk.

6. Privacy & Data Handling (brief)
Include a short paragraph stating:
- No advertising
- No selling of user data
- Analytics are used only to improve app performance
- No unnecessary personal data is collected

Do NOT restate the full privacy policy. Keep it short.

7. Footer
Reuse the existing site footer unchanged.
Ensure links to:
- Privacy Policy
- Main site

Technical requirements
- Page path: /support
- SEO title: “OpenHouse AI Support”
- Meta description: “Support and help for the OpenHouse AI homeowner app.”
- Ensure page returns HTTP 200
- No broken links

Final check
After implementation:
- Verify page loads publicly without authentication
- Verify support email is visible without scrolling
- Verify page visually matches the rest of openhouseai.ie

Proceed to implement now.
