You are a senior creative front-end engineer enhancing the OpenHouseAI marketing site.

🎯 Objective:
Replace the existing random gold wave background with a subtle, cinematic, *architectural realism* R3F (React Three Fiber) scene that visually conveys the “AI assistant for modern developments” brand message.

The new background should feel premium, spatial, and intelligent — light passing through minimal abstract building forms. It must integrate seamlessly into the current homepage hero and perform smoothly.

---

🧩 Implementation Steps:

1️⃣ **Setup**
- Ensure @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, and three are installed.
- Create a new file: `components/FX/ArchitecturalScene.tsx`.
- Use “use client”; and import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber" and ambient/point lights from drei.

2️⃣ **Scene Composition**
- Build a realistic yet abstract architectural environment:
  - A reflective black-gold floor plane.
  - Subtle extruded block geometry suggesting walls and modern homes.
  - Ambient light (soft white) and a moving warm key light (#F5C66B) to simulate sunlight.
  - Shallow fog or atmospheric haze for depth.

- Camera:
  ```ts
  fov: 45
  position: [0, 1.5, 6]
Slight slow pan or parallax effect using useFrame to simulate cinematic drift.

Add a gold volumetric light streak or subtle bloom using drei’s EffectComposer with Bloom for realism.

3️⃣ Performance

Cap the frame rate to 60fps.

Use dpr={[1, 1.5]} for balance.

Ensure GPU usage <70%.

4️⃣ Integration

Replace the existing hero background import (e.g., Background.tsx) with this new scene.

Wrap it in a fixed, full-screen div with z-index behind hero text:

tsx
Copy code
<div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10">
  <ArchitecturalScene />
</div>
5️⃣ Styling

Ensure text and buttons remain clearly legible.

Match the site’s palette: gold (#F6C56E), black (#0A0A0A), and soft white (#F0E8D0).

6️⃣ Fallback

If WebGL fails, show a static blurred gradient background matching the current tone.

7️⃣ Testing

Validate scroll performance with Lenis still enabled.

Ensure the R3F background loads only once (no reinitialisation between scroll sections).

8️⃣ Deliverable
A production-ready, optimized file structure:

cpp
Copy code
components/
  FX/
    ArchitecturalScene.tsx
    index.ts
sections/
  Hero/
    Hero.tsx  // importing ArchitecturalScene
After completion, preview the hero section: it should now feature soft gold lighting moving through abstract building silhouettes, creating a calm, architectural atmosphere that matches the OpenHouseAI identity.
