You are updating the OpenHouse AI marketing website.
Do NOT change navigation code, header, footer, global CSS, Lenis scroll, animations, routes, or core layout components.
This task is content + component cleanup only, using the existing component system and Tailwind utilities.

Follow these instructions precisely:

1. FIX THE “Built for Developers. Loved by Residents.” SECTION

File:
sections/YourCurrentSectionFile.tsx (the file that renders this section — locate it by searching for the heading text)

Replace current content with a clean 2-column layout:
LEFT COLUMN — New Title & Gold Tick Items

Title:
“A Modern Multi-Tenant Platform Architected for Scale.”

Bullet points (all with gold tick icons, no red icons anywhere):

Multi-tenant core (developers, OMCs, residents)

RAG knowledge engine

Onboarding layer (QR/NFC)

Developer dashboard

POI engine

Analytics layer (query trends, knowledge gaps, monthly reporting)

GDPR + EU data residency + audit logs

RIGHT COLUMN — 3 Developer Value Points

Reduce after-sales volumes by 70–90%

Effortless, automated handover experience

Premium, modern resident experience from day one

Grid Requirements

Use existing Section container

grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12

Ensure both columns top-align

Delete

All red X icons

Any overlapping layout or absolute positioning used previously

2. FIX THE FEATURE GRID (Everything You Need. Nothing You Don’t.)

File:
sections/Features.tsx or similar

Make all 8 feature cards the same height

Apply to all card wrappers:

min-h-[260px] (adjust if necessary but use a fixed minimum height)

flex flex-col justify-between

p-6

All cards must use identical internal spacing

Limit titles to max 2 lines

Limit descriptions to max 2 lines

Ensure the grid uses:

grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8

This forces perfect uniformity across all boxes.

3. FIX SECURITY & COMPLIANCE SECTION

File:
sections/Security.tsx or similar

Rebuild the grid as a 3×3 layout (6 items = 3×2)

Use: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6

Convert each item into a card using same style as Features

Card wrapper:

rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-white/5 p-6

On hover:

transform scale-[1.02]

border-gold-400/40

shadow-lg shadow-black/30

smooth transition

Keep the 6 items:

GDPR-first

EU data residency

Audit logs

Encryption at rest & transit

No LLM training

Fully sandboxed developments

4. REBUILD THE SOLUTIONS PAGE TO MATCH THE NEW PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE

File:
app/solutions/page.tsx or sections/SolutionsContent.tsx

Replace existing layout with the following structure:
Primary 3-Column Stakeholder Layout
1. Developers

Multi-scheme oversight

Document management

Global updates

Analytics + insights

Monthly reporting

Handover automation

2. OMCs / Property Managers

Issue categorisation

Resident communication

Manual uploads

Warranty workflows

Access to queries + trending topics

3. Residents

NFC onboarding

POI mapping

Home-specific AI companion

Manuals & drawings

Community tools

Use:
grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-12

Secondary Use-Case Row

Add four smaller boxes below:

After-Sales Support

Handover & Completions

International Buyer Support

Resident Engagement

Use:
grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6

Card style must match Feature cards.

5. GLOBAL POLISH FIXES
Spacing

Add py-28 or equivalent above and below major sections for consistent vertical rhythm.

Headings

Apply unified <h2> styling across all pages.

Ensure consistent font weight, letter-spacing, and padding.

Containers

Ensure all major sections use the same max-width wrapper (likely max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6).

Do NOT Modify

Navigation

Header

Footer

Lenis scroll

Global CSS

Button components

Hero visuals

Background animations

This is strictly content + layout refinement.
