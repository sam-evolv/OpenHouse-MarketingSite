You are fixing the homepage section that contains the two large cards:

“A Modern Multi-Tenant Platform Architected for Scale.”

“Built for Developers. Loved by Residents.”

Your task is to make both lists align perfectly row-by-row, with identical spacing, identical row height, and identical vertical start position, regardless of text length.

1. Wrap BOTH cards in a unified 2-column grid

Replace the parent container with:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 w-full">


This ensures the cards always align.

2. Each card must use THIS EXACT layout

Replace both card wrappers with:

<div className="bg-black/20 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl p-10 flex flex-col">

3. LOCK BOTH HEADINGS to the SAME HEIGHT

Wrap each heading inside:

<div className="h-[110px] flex items-start">
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold leading-tight">
    {HEADING_TEXT}
  </h2>
</div>


This prevents line-wrapping from shifting list alignment.

4. Force BOTH bullet lists into identical 7-row grids

Replace BOTH <ul> blocks with:

<ul className="grid grid-rows-7 gap-4">


Every <li> becomes:

<li className="flex items-start gap-3 leading-snug">
  <CheckIcon className="w-5 h-5 text-yellow-500 shrink-0 mt-1" />
  <span className="block">{TEXT}</span>
</li>


This forces each bullet row to take the exact same height.

5. HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT GUARANTEE

Make sure BOTH cards have:

className="flex flex-col justify-start"


No justify-between, no min-h, no auto heights.

6. FINAL CARD HEIGHT (fix both to match)

Add:

className="h-[720px]"


to BOTH cards.

7. REMOVE ALL OLD SPACING, FLEX, OR GRID WRAPPERS

Delete:

previous flex row/column containers

any placeholder <li>

any extra padding around headings

any min-h or overflow logic

Only the new structure should exist.

✅ END RESULT YOU WILL SEE
✔ Two cards
✔ Same height
✔ Same heading height
✔ Same row count
✔ Same row height
✔ Checkmarks perfectly aligned down and across
✔ Identical spacing
✔ Identical left/right visual weight
✔ Looks like a top-tier SaaS marketing site

Exactly what you asked for.
