Replit Agent Prompt - Replace “Pricing” With “Engagement Model” (Per-Scheme Pricing, Relationship-Friendly)

Goal
- Remove the current “Pricing” section and replace it with a new section called “Engagement Model” that explains per-scheme pricing and relationship-based rollout.
- Update the top navigation so the “Pricing” item becomes “Engagement Model” and scrolls to the new section anchor.
- Do this without changing the visual style, spacing system, or CTA design language.
- Keep it fully reversible by isolating changes to a small set of files.

Constraints
- Do NOT introduce hard prices, tiers, or SaaS-style plans.
- Do NOT change global typography, colours, layout grid, animations, or existing CTA styling.
- Reuse the existing section component patterns and spacing utilities.
- Keep UK English spelling (scheme, enrolment if used, etc.).
- Avoid casual language. Keep it infrastructure-grade.

What to build

Phase A - Navigation update
1) Find where the top nav items are defined (likely in one of these):
   - components/navigation/*.tsx
   - components/layout/Header*.tsx
   - components/Nav*.tsx
2) Replace the nav label “Pricing” with “Engagement Model”.
3) Ensure it links to an anchor id that you will add on the page: #engagement-model
4) Keep order the same (Solution, Capabilities, Case Studies, Engagement Model, Docs).
5) Ensure the mobile nav menu mirrors the same label and link.

Phase B - Replace the Pricing section with Engagement Model section
1) Locate the current pricing section component. Search for:
   - “Pricing”
   - “Starter”
   - “Growth”
   - “Enterprise”
   - “billing”
   Likely locations:
   - components/sections/Pricing*.tsx
   - sections/Pricing*.tsx
   - app/page.tsx or app/(marketing)/page.tsx section imports
2) Remove the pricing section from the page composition and replace with a new section component:
   - components/sections/EngagementModel.tsx (create this file if it does not exist)
3) Insert the new section in the same place the Pricing section used to appear (do not reorder other sections).

Engagement Model section content (exact copy)
- Section anchor id: engagement-model

Headline:
Designed around each development

Subheading:
Every scheme is different. OpenHouse AI is structured per development, taking into account scale, phase, and operational needs. We work directly with developers to define the right rollout and scope.

Cards (use the same card styling as other grids, 4 cards on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile):
1) Per-scheme scope
   Define what is included per development, based on your handover needs and resident experience.

2) Rollout by phase
   Start with one block or phase, then expand across the full scheme once the model is proven.

3) Clear onboarding model
   QR and NFC activation aligned to your handover process, with documentation structured per home.

4) Long-term partnership
   Designed to leave room for continuous improvement and new modules over time.

CTA row (reuse existing CTA styling and button components)
- Primary button: Book a Demo (existing behaviour, do not change routing)
- Secondary text link/button: Discuss your scheme
  If you already have a contact section or demo booking flow, link there.
  If not, link to the same destination as Book a Demo for now, but keep a distinct label.

Micro-line under CTAs (small muted text, optional):
No fixed tiers. Scope agreed per development.

Phase C - Remove dead references
1) Search the site for “Pricing” and update any internal anchor references and labels that were specifically pointing to the old pricing section.
2) Keep any general copy that mentions “pricing available” out of the site unless it is rewritten to reflect per-scheme scoping.

Acceptance criteria
- The nav item now reads “Engagement Model” on desktop and mobile.
- Clicking it smoothly scrolls to the new section (id="engagement-model").
- The Pricing section no longer exists on the page.
- The new section matches the existing site styling (cards, spacing, typography, hover behaviour).
- No other visual diffs across the site.

Deliverables
- New section component: components/sections/EngagementModel.tsx (or existing pattern location)
- Updated page composition to render Engagement Model instead of Pricing
- Updated navigation labels and anchors
