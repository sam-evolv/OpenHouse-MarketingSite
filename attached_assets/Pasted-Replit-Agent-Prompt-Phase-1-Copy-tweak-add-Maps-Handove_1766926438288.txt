Replit Agent Prompt (Phase 1 - Copy tweak: add Maps + Handover files and savings)

Goal:
Update the existing “Two portals. One platform.” section copy only. Do not change layout, styling, spacing, animations, or component structure. Keep the design identical.

Context:
This section already exists and is rendering (Two cards: Resident Portal, Developer Portal). We only need to adjust the bullet points.

Tasks:
1) Resident Portal card:
   - Add a new bullet that explicitly mentions the Maps function.
   - Keep it in the same bullet style and icon pattern used for the other bullets.
   - Recommended wording (UK English, no quantified claims):
     "Maps for local places and essential services"

2) Developer Portal card:
   - Add a new bullet that explicitly references saving time, effort, and money.
   - Add a new bullet that explicitly references handover files.
   - Keep them in the same bullet style and icon pattern used for the other bullets.
   - Recommended wording (UK English, no quantified claims):
     "Reduce time, effort, and unnecessary after-sales cost"
     "Handover files and documentation delivered digitally"

3) Ordering:
   - Keep the existing bullets, just insert the new ones in a logical order:
     Resident Portal (example order):
     - Instant answers to everyday home questions
     - Maps for local places and essential services
     - Digital handover documents in one place
     - Local updates via a built-in notice board

     Developer Portal (example order):
     - Visibility into resident questions and recurring issues
     - Spot patterns early and reduce after-sales overhead
     - Reduce time, effort, and unnecessary after-sales cost
     - Handover files and documentation delivered digitally
     - Understand what residents actually need, post-handover

Implementation Notes:
- Find the component that renders this section (likely components/sections/TwoPortals.tsx).
- Modify only the copy/content array for the bullet list(s).
- Reuse existing icon components already imported in the file. If there is no suitable icon, reuse an existing one rather than importing a new library.
- Do not touch any other sections, navigation, or CSS.

Deliverable:
- Copy updates applied and verified in Preview on desktop and mobile.
