REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — FIX, REFORMAT & SYMMETRISE THE ENTIRE FEATURE SECTION BELOW “Residents.”

You are updating the homepage hero feature section located immediately below the “Residents.” heading.
The layout currently displays two large cards:

Left: “A Modern Multi-Tenant Platform Architected for Scale.”

Right: “Built for Developers. Loved by Residents.”

This section is visually unbalanced, asymmetrical, and lacks enterprise polish.
Your task is to fully clean, rebuild, and symmetrise this section.

Follow these instructions exactly:

1. REPLACE THE ENTIRE LAYOUT WITH A CLEAN, SYMMETRICAL 2-CARD STRUCTURE

Each card must use this wrapper:

className="w-full md:w-1/2 bg-black/20 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl p-10 flex flex-col space-y-6 h-[680px]"


This guarantees:

identical height

identical padding

identical card visual weight

enterprise-level consistency

2. UPDATE THE BULLET LISTS TO EXACTLY 7 ITEMS EACH
LEFT CARD — KEEP THESE 7 BULLETS

Multi-tenant core (developers, OMCs, residents)

RAG knowledge engine

Onboarding layer (QR/NFC)

Developer dashboard

POI engine

Analytics layer (query trends, knowledge gaps, monthly reporting)

GDPR + EU data residency + audit logs

RIGHT CARD — USE THESE 7 OUTCOMES

Replace the existing 3 with these 7:

Reduce after-sales volumes by 70–90%

Effortless, automated handover experience

Premium, modern resident experience from day one

Centralised knowledge reduces repeated queries

Faster warranty issue resolution

Improved resident satisfaction & brand perception

Scalable across all developments instantly

3. FORCE PERFECT ROW-FOR-ROW ALIGNMENT

Wrap all bullets in:

<ul className="grid grid-rows-7 gap-3">


Each bullet:

<li className="flex items-start gap-3 leading-snug">
  <CheckIcon className="w-5 h-5 text-yellow-500 shrink-0 mt-0.5" />
  <span>TEXT HERE</span>
</li>


This ensures:

identical row structure

checkmarks align across both cards

typography aligns horizontally

4. FIX THE COLUMN SPACING

Replace the outer container with:

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-10 md:gap-16 w-full">


This removes the awkward spacing in the screenshot.

5. REMOVE ALL OLD CODE FOR THIS SECTION

Delete:

old containers

float layouts

inconsistent padding

duplicated wrappers

placeholder <li> lines

any scroll/overflow logic

Only the new two-card layout should remain.

6. FINAL EXPECTED RESULT

The section must display:

two identical-height premium cards

equal 7-bullet lists

perfect left/right alignment

consistent spacing

no overflow, no scroll

clean enterprise UI

visually balanced composition

Exactly what you see on top-tier SaaS landing pages.
